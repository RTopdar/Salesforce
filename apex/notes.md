# Apex Programming Language

## What is Apex Programming Language

- Object Oriented Programming language
  - Supports class, interface, inheritance
  - Uses java like syntax
  - Acts like database stored procedures
- Strongly Typed
  - Validates references to objects at compile time
- Integrated with databse
  - We get direct access to records and their fields
- Allow developers to add business logics to system events, inclusing onclicks, record updates, and visualforce pages
- One can call apex code through Web Service request and Triggers on Objects

## Characteristics

- Integrated
  - Provides built in support for common Lightining Platform features
- Easy to use
  - Uses Java like syntax which is easy to learn
  - Based on familiar Java idioms
- Data Focused
  - Provides transactional access to the database. We can also roll back changes
- Rigorous
  - Strongly typed, so we can catch errors at compile time. It uses direct references to schema objects such as objects and fields API
- Hosted
  - Runs on the Lightning Platform, so we don't have to worry about infrastructure. Interpreted, executed, and controlled entirely by Lightning Platform
- Multi Tenant Aware
  - Runs in multi tenant environment just liek the rest of Lightning Platform
- Easy to Test
  - Provides built in support for unit tests creation and execution. Test results indicate what code is covered by tests
- Versioned
  - Supports versioning of Apex classes and triggers. One can save apex code against different versions of the API

## Which Editions Contain Apex

- Developer Edition
- Enterprise Edition
- Unlimited Edition
- Performance Edition
- Database.com Edition

## When to use Apex

- Create Web Services and Email Services
- Perform complex validation over multiple objects
- Create complex buisness logics which cannot be created using workflows
- Create custom logic that occurs over the entire transaction
- Attach custom logic to other operations. For example, save a record whenever an operation is executed, regardless of the source of the operation like UI, Visualforce, API, etc.

## What are Supported by Apex

- Class, Interface, Collection (List, Set, Map)
- Objects, Array notation, Expressions, Variable, constants
- Conditional Statements, Loop
- Cloud Dev, as it is stored, compiled, and executed on the cloud
- Triggers to execute code before or after events
- Database statements to query, insert, update, and delete records
- Transaction control statements to control the execution of the transaction and rollbacks
- The global access modifier allows access across namespaces and applications
- Versioning of custom Apex code
